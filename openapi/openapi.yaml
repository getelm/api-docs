    # Introduction

    Weâ€™ve designed the elm API to give FMCG brands and third parties easier access to their key sales data. See more info below on how to fetch data from the elm API.

    # Note on Data Freshness

    We work hard to keep our data fresh and accurate. 
    Our system undergoes a daily data synchronisation process with all retailer connections to ensure that our dataset accurately reflects retroactive changes made by these retailers.
    This synchronisation typically covers the previous 4-7 days, depending on the specific data processing practices of each retailer.


    Retailers often apply these backdated modifications to their data. 
    Daily updates are required to ensure the most up-to-date and precise historical data, which reflects what is available on the retailer's own platform.


    In practical terms, this means that if you were to retrieve sales totals for a Sunday on a Monday, the total for that Sunday may change when viewed on subsequent days such as Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.


    To accommodate these retailer-driven data changes effectively, we recommend including a request for data that spans approximately the last seven days in every API call.
    By doing so, you can ensure access to the most current information.
    When adding this data to your database, you can:

    1. Keep all versions but use the most recent data.

    2. Clear the previous day's data before adding new results.


    This ensures 100% accuracy when handling retroactive changes, avoiding potential discrepancies of up to around 1% in historical sales totals if these practices are not followed.

    # API Keys

    This API relies on an API key for authentication. To generate/access your
    API key please make sure that you have admin level access to your Elm account. 


    To generate your API key:

    - Log in to your account and, navigate to [Account Settings](https://dashboard.getelm.co/account) 

    - Visit the API tab

    - On this page you will be able to generate an API key, view your key, and regenerate your key if your existing one is lost or exposed.


    Please note that API keys are sensitive pieces of information and as such
    should be kept secret, like a password.


    # Authentication

    Once you have your API key, you can use it for authentication by including
    it in the authorization header of your requests.


    **Headers:**

    ```

    Authorization: Token <your token>

    ```

    ## Example request

    This request can be used to test your connection to the API. A successful
    request and authorization will return `{"success":true}`

    ```

    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.getelm.co/api/test/ \
      --header 'Authorization: <your token>'
    ```
