summary: Get all actions
description: >-
  This endpoint returns a list of all active actions, insights and alerts as set out in your elm account along with accompanying information by retailer for a given week. This data set is often used as the first step in a successful field visit, for example, as it outlines problem stores.
  
  
  Note: Actions are refreshed weekly and so please plan your API requests accordingly. We’d recommend pulling through actions on a Tuesday.
